# TimeToCookUpAnswers
## Introduction
The recipes and ratings dataset contains recipes and their reviews and ratings posted since 2008 from the food.com website. My analysis will be centered around the question: what is the relationship between the cooking time and the average rating of recipes? Shorter cooking times may result in easier and quicker recipes, but that does not guarantee a high rating. On the other hand, longer cooking times may require more effort, which may result in better-tasting recipes. Readers of the website can benefit from this analysis as it can help them discern which recipes will be easier to make and which ones will be more time-consuming. It can also help them determine the ideal level of effort and time that each recipe requires to achieve the desired rating. 
I have chosen to work with the recipe and ratings dataset which contains information about different recipes and their reviews posted since 2008 on the website food.com. This dataset has 83,782 rows. The names of the columns that are relevant to my question are the minutes, name, and the average_rating columns. The minutes column provides the number of minutes it takes to prepare each recipe. The name column provides the recipe name and the average_rating column provides the average rating for each recipe.
